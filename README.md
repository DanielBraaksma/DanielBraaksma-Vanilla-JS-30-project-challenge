# DanielBraaksma-Vanilla-JS-30-project-challenge

My completed version of Wes Bos 30 projects challenge

## Purpose
After getting more comfortable with vanilla JavaScript I want to challenge myself to continue building and practicing through repetition.

I want to ensure that I have a solid foundation of concepts that I have learned and having a series of projects to work on seems like a great.
way to get my hands on the keyboard and code!

### Layout
-Each project is a mini challenge incorporating the basics of front end web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-Considering the scale of the projects I think it is reasonable to be able to complete one a day.

-Tartget date for finishing: April 9th 2022

### Next Steps
Once completed, I would like to come up with my own project that that is unique and more in depth.
